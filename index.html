            Hi, I'm Mamadou Balde! <img src="html_finalprojimages/waving-hand.png" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
            I am currently a senior at Lehman College, majoring in Computer Information Systems, after previously studying video arts and technology at BMCC. 
            I completed an internship at Jefferies Financial Group as an IT Analyst, where I gained valuable insights into finance, investment banking, and trading technologies.
            I applied skills like Python and SQL while learning new ones such as server monitoring and market data analysis. 
            I am eager to learn, open to feedback, and passionate about new technologies. My goal is to work for a company that leverages technology to address challenges and
            fosters a culture that encourages authenticity, learning, and growth.
